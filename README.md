## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an **advanced deep learning framework for multivariate time series forecasting**, with a specific focus on integrating an **attention mechanism into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network**.  

The objective is to **outperform traditional forecasting benchmarks** such as:
- Standard LSTM
- Classical statistical models (SARIMA)

The model is evaluated on a **complex, real-world, publicly available dataset** involving **hourly energy consumption**, demonstrating robust preprocessing, model design, and rigorous experimental evaluation.

## 🧩 Attention Mechanism

The attention layer learns to assign **dynamic importance weights** to different time steps within each input sequence. This enables the model to:
- Focus on the most relevant historical information
- Improve long-horizon forecasting accuracy
- Provide interpretability via attention weight visualization

## 🏋️ Training Strategy

- Train/Test split: **80% / 20%**
- Sliding window sequence length: **24 hours**
- Optimizer: **Adam**
- Loss Function: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Early stopping with validation monitoring

---

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

All models are evaluated using:

- **RMSE** – Root Mean Squared Error  
- **MAE** – Mean Absolute Error  
- **MAPE** – Mean Absolute Percentage Error  

Performance comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the attention mechanism over baseline approaches.
